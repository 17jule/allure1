## Behaviors

Allure provides ability to create testing based on functional requirements. You can define requirements to your
application and create tests which checks concrete functionality or user story. We provide behavior-driven development
([BDD]) terms for help your behaviors definition. Your user scenarios are grouped in stories, then stories are grouped
in features.

If you want work as BDD, you need:

* Split project into features
* Find out some user stories for every feature
* Define and implement tests scenarios

Then you will get report where you now which features in the project has bugs.
